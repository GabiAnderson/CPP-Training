# C++ Training Repository

## Course Overview

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey through a C++ programming course that primarily follows the "C++ programming course - beginner to advanced" available on YouTube. The original content is sourced from the Udemy course "The C++20 Masterclass: From Fundamentals to Advanced".

### Course Details

- **YouTube Course**: [C++ programming course - beginner to advanced (learn c++ in 31 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jLOx1hD3_o&t=24969s)
- **Udemy Course**: [The C++20 Masterclass : From Fundamentals to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-cpp-20-masterclass/)

## Course Structure

The YouTube course is a condensed version of the Udemy course, missing different "small" chapters such as Chapter 6 - Literals and Constants. To bridge the gap caused by the missing content, I'll be using supplementary materials such as additional videos and other resources to cover the omitted sections. However, I have access to the Udemy course's source code, which will be utilized whenever necessary.

### Chapter Completion

1. **Chapter 1 - Welcome**: Completed
2. **Chapter 2 - Set Up**: Completed
3. **Chapter 3 - First Steps**: Completed
4. **Chapter 4 - Variables and Data Types**: Completed
5. **Chapter 5 - Operations on Data**: Completed
6. **Chapter 6 - Literals and Constants**: In Progress
    - **Section 1 - Literals**: Supplementing with [C++ Programming Tutorial 28 - Literals ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F27KllsR7Io)

## Notes

In this repository, I've taken the initiative to hand type the code used in the Youtube Course videos, available on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rutura/The-C-20-Masterclass-Source-Code/tree/main). Alongside this code, I'm providing my comments about the sections at the beginning of the main file and integrating related comments throughout the codebase.

Please note that in cases where I've used supplemental videos to cover missing content, I may not include the same code as found in the Youtube GitHub repository. Instead, I will aim to provide detailed comments and explanations in relation to the supplementary material.

My goal is to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the covered topics, making the codebase not only a representation of the course materials but also a resource for in-depth learning and reference.
